# Star Wars API formatter

This simple script wrapped in a basic web server queries the Star Wars API (swapi) and returns data on all the movies.

## Usage

- Clone the respository and navigate to the created folder on your terminal
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the web server with `npm start`
- On your browser go to `http://localhost:4200` (It takes around 5 seconds to load all the information)
- For a better display use a JSON viewer plug-in on your browser
